# MSMQ
Here's an example of a container hosting a WebAPI front end and a Windows Service backend that communication with each other via MSMQ. While this is functional, it's a contrived scenario and still a work-in-progress. I intend to break this out into two seperate pods with the MSMQs exposed as services.
